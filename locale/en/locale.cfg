Increases when they get fed.\n	    Can rise above 100% which unlocks endgame modifiers,\n	    granting them increased damage and health.\n\n	    - THREAT -\n     Causes biters to attack. Reduces when biters are slain.\n	    Feeding gives permanent "threat-income", as well as creating instant threat.\n	    A high threat value causes big attacks. Values of zero or below will cause no attacks.
